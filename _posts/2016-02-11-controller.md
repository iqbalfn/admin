This is how to create controller. Or the controller can also be generated by 
[controller generator]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-02-11-controller-generator %}).

1. The controller name should start with upper case, and lower case for the rest.
2. Extends the controller with `MY_Controller`
3. The controller file name should be controller name + `.php`.
4. Save the file to `application/controllers`.

For example, controller name for object `user` is `User` with file name 
`User.php`. And the controller name for `user perms` should be `Userperms`
with file name `Userperms.php`.

Example of `user` controller:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

{% endhighlight %}
